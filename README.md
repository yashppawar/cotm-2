## Description

The prices of several commodities including fruits and vegetables are unpredictable in today's time mainly due to climate change, insufficient rainfall and poor harvesting conditions. Additionally, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, vegetable prices have skyrocketed making it difficult for people to buy such essentials from the retailers and vendors.

Therefore, it is crucial for people to be aware of the abrupt price change and buy the vegetables at the right time as per their needs.

## Challenge

In this month's challenge, you are going to contribute towards solving this problem for the society. Let's see how:

1. Several govt. of India portals host open-sourced data of vegetable prices. Some sources to download the dataset are:

https://www.kaggle.com/samextensibleenergy/agricultural-commodity-dataset

2. Download any dataset from the given sources or any other you may like and write a python code to explore this dataset.
3. Under exploration, you need to:
    - Clean the dataset to remove any anomalies
    - Discover patterns/trends/relationships within the data that describe ways in which vegetable price change can be predicted.
